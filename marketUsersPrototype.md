  The websites Vrbo, Blue Pillow, and Windu are great comparisons to Marriott Homes

## Understand Your Users
*Write a short paragraph (50-100 words) describing the themes that emerged from the user research*

The user research suggests that most people want to take a vacation; they just do not know where they want to go. The Marriott website is easy to navigate if you know when and where you want to go. For those that are unsure the map is overwhelming and the popular destinations do not have any information about them available. Users are looking for more of a guided experience. They want to know why the destinations are popular. They do not want a map with random destinations in their face, a small questionnaire before the map would be a good alternative.

*Don't forget to include a comment if you attempted any of the LevelUps, so that your grader knows to review your work and award the extra credit!*

I added a "Get New Recommendations" that pulls back up the pop up incase the user chnaged their minds.
